Work Done
Front End:
Reformatting of the menu page.
Restaurants now include a category array.
Restaurants now includes an array of “Restaurants” with different restaurants and their properties.
Restaurant overall ratings implemented.
A restaurant’s menu sorts different dishes into their respective category and displays them horizontally under the category.
Individual web pages are now rendered/routed for different restaurants in the restaurants array.
Searching feature now implemented.
Users can search through an existing list of restaurants either by name or by one of the dishes.
Search results are listed from highest overall rating of restaurant to lowest.
Cypress unit tests created

Back End:
For the backend of our group’s application, we have developed a user registration functionality that will allow users to create accounts that will be stored in our database.

The backend has also developed a functionality that will allow users to remain logged in to their account that they have created.

A logout functionality has also been developed to allow users to logout of a given account that they registered with on our application.

In terms of connecting the frontend and backend, we have developed connections that allow for the user to register an account, login to their account, and logout of their account. 

Our group has also hosted a MySQL database on Oracle Cloud, which will allow all group members to access our application’s database on different devices.
