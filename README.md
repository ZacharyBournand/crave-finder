# Project name
Local Resto

# Project description
The user search through them by looking up individual items on the menu. In addition to rating a restaurant on its cleanliness, customer service, wait times, etc. they could also rate menu items individually. Maybe we can store these ratings on a profile, so that if you find your tastes are particularly similar to someone else’s you can try foods/places they’ve rated highly.
