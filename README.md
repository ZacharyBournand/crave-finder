# Project name
Local Resto

# Project description
It would be a web application to search for local restaurant. 

The user can search for local restaurants and look up individual items on their menus. 
The user can also rate a restaurant on its cleanliness, customer service, wait times, etc. & rate individual menu items as well. 
A user's ratings can be stored on their profile, so that if another person finds their tastes to be particularly similar to that of the user, that person can try foods/places this user has rated highly.
