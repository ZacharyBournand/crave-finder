Our web applicaton seeks to make finding new flavors at local restaurants a piece of cake!

On our web app, the user would be able to search for local restaurants that have a particular menu item they're craving. Want to go and get crab rangoons? No problem. Heard of something that sounded good, but don't know what the name of the restaurant is called? No big deal.

Once the user decides on a restaurant, they will be able to view their menu directly from the web app. In addition to this, each restaurant on our app will have a collection of ratings. A restaurant will have ratings for cleanliness, customer service, wait times, an overall rating, and most importantly: a restaurant's menu will have each item rated individually.

User ratings will be stored on their profile allowing other users to compare tastes and possibly explore dishes and restuarants that people with similar tastes have rated highly.

## Main Takeaways:
- Search for restaurants by menu items
- Rate menu items individually or the restaurant as a whole
- Store food ratings on user profile
