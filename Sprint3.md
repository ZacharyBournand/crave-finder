**WORK DONE**

Front End:
- Made arrays of restaurants an actual array of restaurants (instead of an array of incredibly restaurant-like entities).
- Added support for large dish arrays in the menu, buttons for scrolling through categories added.
- Made user reviews editable/viewable to user on account page
- Made restaurant reviews readonly (only editable by logged-in users on their own page).
- Updated visuals of homepage (background image no longer overflows) and top bar.
- Search bar now uses backendâ€™s Yelp restaurant API
- Login status is now maintained and tracked through the homepage. Added the ability to log out as well.
- Jasmine unit tests created for most components.
- Modified the Search Results page by implementing the form that enables a user to search for a restaurant/food item

Back End:
- Made rating function that stores the ratings made by a user inside our sql database.
- Connected the backend with an API that contains a list of restaurants, foods served, and additional information. It is the Yelp Fusion API.
- Made a function that connect with the Yelp API and the front-end code to retrieve the requested information by a user that searches for a restaurant or food item in a specified city and gets that information from the Yelp API. Then, it sends the data to the front-end to display it.
- Halfway through the implementation of a functionality that allows the user to change their password. It currently retrieves the user's password, a required to authenticate them before allowing this functionality. But it doesn't change an account's password yet.
- Implemented unit tests for completed functions


**TESTING**

Front End:

Home-page component (Cypress tests):
- Tests if the homepage component (specifically the search bar and buttons) render properly.
- Tests if the search bar takes an input properly. Nav-menu component:
- Tests if the button renders properly.
- Tests to see if the drop-down menu becomes visible after clicking on the nav-menu. Login-page component:
- Tests if the username box takes an input properly.
- Tests if the password box takes an input properly. User-registration component:
- Tests if the username box takes an input properly.
- Tests if the password box takes an input properly.


Back End:

Registration

- Created a mock test that runs the user registration functionality to see if the function can run correctly. 

Login Test

- Created a mock test that runs the login functionality to see if the function can run correctly. 

Logout Test

- Created a mock test that runs the logout functionality to see if the function can run correctly.

Search Test

- Created a mock test that runs the search functionality to see if the function can run correctly.

Rating Test

- Created a mock test that runs the rating functionality to see if the function can run correctly.

**GOLANG API DOCUMENTATION**

Our Golang API handles user registration, login, and logout that communicates with a MySQL database we created that contains a table named "users" to store user information.

Dependencies
- gorilla/handlers
- gorilla/sessions
- go-sql-driver/mysql


Variables
- db: It holds the connection to the MySQL database.
- store: It holds and handles a session created using gorilla/sessions.


Structs
- User: It contains the username and password of a user that are JSON-encoded and stored as strings.
- RegisterResponse: It contains a JSON-encoded message field that stores a success message or an error message depending on the outcome of the task.


Functions
- main(): It starts the server and sets up the routes for the API.

- registerAuthHandler(): It handles a new user registration by accepting a POST request with a User object; it then checks if the user already exists in the database. If the user does not exist, it creates a new account with a hashed password and stores it in the database. Otherwise, it outputs an error message.

- loginAuthHandler(): It handles authentication for existing users by accepting a POST request with a User object; it then checks if the given username and password match an account in the database.

- logoutHandler(): It ends the current user session by logging the user out.


Endpoints
- POST /registerauth: It handles user registration by receiving a User object (JSON-encoded) in the request body and responding with a RegisterResponse object (JSON-encoded) containing a success or error message depending on the task's outcome.

- POST /loginauth: It handles user login by receiving a User object (JSON-encoded) in the request body and responding with a session cookie if the user is successfully authenticated.

- POST /logout: It handles user logout by getting a valid session cookie in the request; it then ends the current user session.


Running the API

To run the API, open a terminal and navigate to the project directory ending in "crave-finder\backend", then type the command "go run main.go". Once the terminal displays "Successful connection to the database", it is now available at http://localhost:8080.
If you use instead connect via the front-end to http://localhost:4200, you can run the Golang API by having the front-end communicate with it to create an account, log in, or log out.
